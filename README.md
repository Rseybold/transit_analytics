# CitySync
CitySync is a web application side project that is meant to offer an open source transit and city planning program to interested parties. The overall goal of this project is to allow for planners and residents to have a mutual understanding of how changes to local transit and planning affect not only day-to-day activities for residents, but how they lead to long term economic and societal changes. This project will pull from peer-reviewed articles and generally accepted planning standards to inform analytics and recommendations made from this program. All articles or assumptison can be found in the "doc/research" folder and will be visible in end product web app via citations.  

## Cities Covered 
While the long-term goal of this project would be to open up any urban or semi-urban center, the starting proof of concept will focus around the DC-Maryland-Virgina Metropolitan region, specifally on Arlington County and DC.
